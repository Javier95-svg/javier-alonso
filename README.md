Helping Creators Build Startups w/ No-Code | Business Development | MSc Digital Marketing

I'm a driven professional with experience across business development, digital marketing, and project management. Over the years, I’ve worked on both client-focused roles and independent projects, building a versatile skill set that combines strategic thinking with hands-on execution.

Most recently, I launched and manage Creatives Takeover, a digital platform that supports creators and entrepreneurs in the AI-driven economy. From building the website and developing content strategy to managing social media and growing the community, I’ve overseen the full lifecycle of the project independently. This experience has strengthened my ability to take ideas from concept to execution while applying creativity, adaptability, and problem-solving skills.

I'm passionate about helping businesses and individuals grow through effective strategy, digital solutions, and innovation. My expertise spans digital content strategy, social media management, community engagement, business development, and platform development.
